# todoApp
A very simple todo application built 3 times to show the difference of jquery and vuejs
## Context
This was built for a simple tutorial that I did to showcase the value of a modern frontend framework.
This is a very basic application (no routing, no store)

## Application Requirements
1. a list with all the todos
2. a counter that says how many todos are left
3. a way to insert new todos
4. a way to remove todos
5. a message when there are no todos left

Both approaches have some preinserted todo items
